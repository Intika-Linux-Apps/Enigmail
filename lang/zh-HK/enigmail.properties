pgpNotSupported=You seem to be using OpenPGP together with PGP 6.x\n\nUnfortunately, PGP 6.x has a number of issues that prevent Enigmail from working correctly. Therefore, Enigmail does not support PGP 6.x anymore; please switch to GnuPG (GPG) instead.\n\nIf you need help on switching to GnuPG, check the Help section of the Enigmail homepage.
